# Tic Tac Toe

Write a program that plays tic-tac-toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid game for two players.
You should create an array to represent the board
- can be of type char and consist of 10 elements (do not use 0)
- each element represents a coordinate on the board that the user can select

Some functions that you should create:
- checkForWin: checks to see if the player has won or the game is a draw
- drawboard: redraws the board for each player's turn
- markBoard: sets the char array with a selection and check for an invalid selection
